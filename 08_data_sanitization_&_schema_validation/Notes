- min & max - use for a number
- minLength & maxLength - use for string
- custome - validate function

  validate(value){
            if(!["male", "female", "others"].includes(value)){
                throw new Error("Gender data is not valid !");
            }
        }
@ Note - this validate function is only applicable, if new user is created, it will not applicable in patch(update method)
       - so, to apply in update (patch method) we are using "runValidators"


# Api level validation
- like, I dont want to allow email to update, after the user is created
- user should able to update certain field of the profile

# credential validation
- we use external library - validator
