1. route handeling
2. note - order of route handlesr matter a lot - we can see in case-03 and case-04 in app.js

3. app.use() => can handle any type of method
# HTTP METHODS
1. whenever you type any url on browser, you make GET api call by default 
2. we have to write explicitly in our code make other request methods
3. created the get, post, delete method
4. regex - Regex (Regular Expressions) are used to match, search, validate, and manipulate patterns in text instead of matching exact strings.
   - Email validation - /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
   - Phone number validation - /^[0-9]{10}$/
5. diffrence b/w query and params
   - req.query - identify by ?, Resource is mandatory, 
   - req.params - identify by :, Data is optional

| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Source      | **URL path**                     | **Query string (`?`)** |
| Mandatory   | Usually **required**             | Usually **optional**   |
| Purpose     | Identify a **specific resource** | Filter, sort, paginate |
| REST usage  | Resource identification          | Resource modification  |
