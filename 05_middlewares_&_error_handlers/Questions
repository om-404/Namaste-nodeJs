# questions for interview

1. what is middleware ?
=> Middleware is a function that runs in between the request coming from the client and the response sent by the server, used to process, modify, or check the request before moving forward.

# why middleware are required ?
- We need middleware to process, check, or modify a request before it reaches the route handler.
- Without middleware, we would have to write the same logic inside every route handler, making the code messy and hard to maintain.

Very short real-world use cases :
Authentication (checking login)
Logging requests
Parsing request data
Error handling

2. what is request handler ?
=> A request handler is the final function that handles a request and returns a response to the client.
Client sends request ➝
Middleware checks/modifies it ➝
Request handler sends the response

3. what is next() ?
=> next is a function used in middleware to pass control to the next middleware or request handler.

Middleware → uses next()
Request handler → usually does not use next() because it sends the response

4. what is route handler ?
=> A route handler is a function that runs when a specific URL and HTTP method is matched and it sends the response to the client.

5. Diffrence between app.use() and app.all() ?
=> app.use()
app.use() is used to apply middleware to all HTTP methods for a given path.
Key points:
Used mainly for middleware
Works for ALL HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
Runs before route handlers
Path matching is prefix-based
Common use - Auth, logging, validation

=> app.all()
app.all() is used to handle all HTTP methods for a specific route.
Key points:
Used mainly for route handling
Runs only when the exact route matches
Can act like a route handler
Good for handling “any method” on one route
Common use - Handle one route for all methods
