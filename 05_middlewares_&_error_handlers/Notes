1. Route handler
2. app.use() handle any type of method
3. if we donot send any response { res.send() } then, it will just hanging around(loading and eventually give timeout)

4. multiple route handler
   app.use(</route>, {route handler-1}, {route handler-2}...);

5. next() - it is a function
          - third parameter in handler function after req, res
          - (req, res, next) => {}
          - this method is used to pass the control to the next route handler

6. wrapping routes inside an array doesnot affect the result
app.use("/router", rh1, rh2, rh3, rh4, rh5, rh6);
app.use("/router", [rh1, rh2, rh3, rh4, rh5, rh6]);
app.use("/router", [rh1, rh2, rh3], rh4, rh5, rh6);
app.use("/router", rh1, rh2, [rh3, rh4], rh5, rh6);
app.use("/router", rh1, rh2, rh3, [rh4, rh5, rh6]);

- all will give the same result

7. GET/users(when the route match) ====> chain of middlewares(functions) =====> request Handler
- after the GET/users route matches - then it keep on going with the chain of middlewares - untile it reaches to request handler
- request Handler - are the function, which actually handle the request and give response
- middlewares - all of the functions which goes through in between is known as middleware 

8. HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:
Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)


# app2.js
1. write dummy auth middlewares

# app3.js
1. write dummy aut middleware in seprate folder
2. error handeling middleware

# app4.js - Error Handeling
- using trycatch
- using error route handler
- err - err is the error object passed to Express error-handling middleware when something goes wrong during request processing.
- Normal middleware: (req, res, next)
  Error middleware: (err, req, res, next)
- The first parameter (err) tells Express this is an error handler

Request → Middleware → Route Handler
               ↓
           next(err)
               ↓
        Error Handler (err, req, res, next)

note - error handeling middleware - should be written in the end of routes
