# creating token and cookies - app1.js

- client send the login request (with email and password)
- server validate the email and password
- then server will create a jwt token and add this jwt token inside the cookie
- this token is unique for every single user
- server then send this cookie in response to the client
- now, it is an inbuilt feature of every browser, they store every cookie, whenever the cookie come to browser
- after storing the cookie inside the browser, login process is completed

now,
- when whenever we make api call once again(let say to get the profile), this cookie also go with api call
- then the cookie is validated, the profile info. fetch from the DB and then the response is send back
- now any conncection made or api call made, then this cookie will be send and validated.

now your cookie is expired 
- so, when we make api call with this old cookie, then it will failed the validation
- and if validation is failed then you will be directed to login page 


- app.use(cookieParser());
- npm i cookie-parser
- npm i jsonwebtoken

- create jwt token using jwt.sign()
- validating token using jwt.verify()
