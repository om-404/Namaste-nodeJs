# passing dynamic data into the api

# POST API

- there are diffrent way of sending the data - json, raw, binary...
- we want to send the json data to server(backend) and server send the data to the database and data will be stored in database
- js object - 
{
    firstName: "om",
    lastName: "sonawale",
    email: "om123@gmai.com",
    age: 20,
    gender: "male",
}

- json object - 
{
    "firstName": "om",
    "lastName": "sonawale",
    "email": "om123@gmai.com",
    "age": 20,
    "gender": "male"
}

- reading the request => req is the request
- reading the data object => req.body => data is present in body of the request
- console.log(req) -> give whole object
- console.log(req.body) -> undefined - because we have sent the json data, and our server is not able to read the json data
- server can read only JS object
- to convert json data js data - we need a middleware - express.json()

# GET API

- I want to get all the users from the database
- so, How to get the data from the database ? 
        - we should know what are you getting from the database or which model is used
        - and after that we apply find() function on the userModel
- /user api created  - to get particular user - find({email : <--->}) or findOne({email : <--->})
- /feed - to get all the user from DB - find({})
- /delete - to delete the particular document - findByIdAndDelete(userId)
- /user - using patch - to update the user - findByIdAndUpdate({_id:userId}, data, options)
